The full path that this entry represents.

The full path is created by joining the parents of this entry up to the root initially given to WalkDir::new with the file name of this entry.

Note that this always returns the path reported by the underlying directory entry, even when symbolic links are followed. To get the target path, use path_is_symlink to (cheaply) check if this entry corresponds to a symbolic link, and std::fs::read_link to resolve the target.
